## 🧰 Web Crawling & Scraping Tools

| Name                          | Library (Crawler) | Library (Scraper) | Description |
|------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| **Marcus Joey Sayner**       | `httpx`           | `parsel`           | `httpx` is an async HTTP client used for modern web requests. `parsel` extracts structured data using CSS/XPath selectors. |
| **Muhammad Luqman Hakim**    | `urllib`          | `Selectolax`       | `urllib` handles URL fetching; `Selectolax` is a high-speed HTML parser suited for large pages. |
| **Camily Tang Jia Lei**      | `urllib`          | `BeautifulSoup`    | `urllib` manages HTTP requests; `BeautifulSoup` is used for intuitive parsing of HTML. |
| **Goh Jing Yang**            | `requests`        | `BeautifulSoup`    | `requests` simplifies HTTP calls; `BeautifulSoup` extracts data from page elements. |

## 🗓️ Project Logbook

### 📅 Week 1: Setup & Team Coordination
- Held initial group meeting to distribute roles:
  - Marcus & Goh focused on crawler logic and fetching URLs
  - Luqman & Camily focused on HTML parsing and selector analysis
- Finalized target website: **Carlist.my**
- Identified key data fields: car name, price, location, mileage, year, etc.
- Chose suitable crawler/scraper libraries for each member’s stack
- Designed folder structure and created GitHub repository
- Got verbal confirmation from lecturer on scope and dataset plan

---

### 🧰 Week 2: Crawler Implementation
- Built individual scrapers using different stacks (`httpx + parsel`, `urllib + Selectolax`, etc.)
- Validated data selectors using browser dev tools (e.g., inspect element)
- Wrote modular Python scripts to handle pagination and auto-retry
- Ensured robots.txt compliance and polite scraping delays (1–2 sec)
- Saved first batch of data (~10,000 rows) in JSON format for validation
- Team tested and compared scraper performance and accuracy

---

### ⚙️ Week 3: Data Processing & Optimization
- Cleaned combined dataset:
  - Removed duplicates and null values
  - Standardized price and mileage formats
  - Merged data from all scrapers into a single schema
- Switched from pandas to `Modin`, `Dask`, or `Polars` for performance testing
- Benchmarked:
  - Runtime for merging & cleaning (before vs after optimization)
  - CPU and memory usage
- Saved clean dataset as Part 1 and continued scraping to complete 100k records

---

### 📈 Week 4: Final Report & Submission
- Finalized full dataset (Part 1 & Part 2), confirmed 100k+ records
- Completed report with:
  - Architecture diagram
  - Comparison of scraper stacks
  - Optimization techniques and performance charts
- Created presentation slides summarizing workflow and findings
- Submitted:
  - ✅ Report (Turnitin)
  - ✅ Dataset (JSON files on GitHub)
  - ✅ GitHub repo with code and readme
  - ✅ Presentation slides
